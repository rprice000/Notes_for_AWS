  This file ‚Äî default.json ‚Äî appears to be a very permissive VPC endpoint policy, likely used as a placeholder or default configuration in the LZA VPC endpoint policy system.

üîç What does this file do?
Here‚Äôs the content:

{
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "*",
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
üß≠ Explanation:
"Effect": "Allow" ‚Äì grants access

"Principal": "*" ‚Äì allows any identity (IAM user, role, service, etc.)

"Action": "*" ‚Äì allows all actions

"Resource": "*" ‚Äì applies to all resources

‚úÖ In a VPC endpoint context, this means:
This policy:

Allows any principal to perform any action on any resource through the VPC interface endpoint

Effectively removes access restrictions

üîê Why this exists in LZA
It's likely a default fallback policy for VPC interface endpoints (e.g., for EC2, SSM, STS, etc.)

It ensures functionality when no custom policies are applied yet

It is not meant to be secure ‚Äî just to allow service access during initial setup

‚ö†Ô∏è Security Note
This is not safe for production unless intentionally scoped. You should:

Replace it with tight VPC endpoint policies that:

Allow only specific IAM principals

Limit actions (e.g., ec2:DescribeInstances)

Match your organization‚Äôs security requirements

‚úÖ Summary
Field	Value	Meaning
Effect	Allow	Grants permission
Principal	*	To anyone/everyone
Action	*	For all actions
Resource	*	On all resources

Use Case: Likely used during LZA setup as a permissive default VPC endpoint policy
