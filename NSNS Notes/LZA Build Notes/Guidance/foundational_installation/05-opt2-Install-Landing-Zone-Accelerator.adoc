=== Step 6: Install Landing Zone Accelerator

This section describes the installation of the Landing Zone Accelerator on AWS solution.  This will put in place all the stacks and configurations that will then allow you to manage the Landing Zone via the solution.

The installation of the Landing Zone Accelerator on AWS depends on access to the public link:https://github.com/awslabs/landing-zone-accelerator-on-aws[GitHub repository] that stores the LZA code.  During the installation, the process will reach out to the GitHub repository, pull and build the code to deploy the solution to your account.  In order to do that, a GitHub developer key is required.

.Note
----
There is an alternative in which source code can be uploaded to S3.  If you will be following that process, you DO NOT need to configure the GitHub Developer Key. Skip this section and start at *Run LZA Installer Stack (Self-hosted LZA Source)*.

. Locally clone the LZA github repository by running *git clone https://github.com/awslabs/landing-zone-accelerator-on-aws.git*
. Note that the default branch is the latest version.  Run *git branch* to see the current version name
. Run *zip -q -T -r ../VERSION.zip .* where *VERSION* is the version of LZA to install
. Run *aws s3 cp ../VERSION.zip s3://BUCKET*.  Where *BUCKET* is the bucket you created in previous steps
. Run *cd source*
. Run *yarn install && yarn build*
. When that is complete change to *cd packages/\@aws-accelerator/installer/*
. Run *cdk synth --context use-s3-source=true --context s3-source-kms-key-arn=ARN* where *ARN* is the arn of your KMS Key you used in a previous step

This creates your installer CloudFormation template and places it in *cdk.out/AWSAccelerator-InstallerStack.template.json*
