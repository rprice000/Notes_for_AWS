For Intuitive Machines, the AWS Organization already existed.  There was no need to configure Organizations for the Commercial environment.  The original *management account* for the Organization was *Ryan Necessary - IM*.  We renamed this account to *IM-Comm-Mgt* (ending in 1026).  The following was executed in that account.

[start=1]
. From the service search bar, type *CloudFormation* and select *CloudFormation*
. Select *Stacks* from the menu on the left
. Select the *Create stack* button in the center of the page
. Leave *Choose an existing template* selected
. Leave *Amazon S3 URL* selected under *Specify template*
. For Amazon S3 URL enter: *https://s3.amazonaws.com/solutions-reference/landing-zone-accelerator-on-aws/latest/AWSAccelerator-GovCloudAccountVending.template*
. Select *Next*
. For Stack name, enter: *AWSAccelerator-GovCloudAccountVending*
. Select *Next*
. Scroll to the bottom and select the checkbox next to *I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources*.
. Select *Next*
. Scroll to the bottom of the *Review and create* page and select *Submit*


This will begin the creation of the resources needed for vending new accounts.  Wait until that stack displays *CREATE_COMPLETE*.
